### Industrial Engineer & Data Scientist - Gestion Control Management
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Data Scientist & Industrial Engineer with over 4 years of experience as a Gestión Control Manager & Functional Analyst specialised in Business Analysis, Management Control, and Consulting. My profile enables me to bridge the worlds of tools to develop, design, plan, integrate, control, and communicate business intelligence. I understand, conceptualise, orchestrate, and effectively communicate key variables that impact business activities. 

Throughout my career, I have successfully formulated and executed complex projects that scrutinise businesses, enhance performance, and provide insights into results and conclusions.I have expertise in designing and constructing integrated management control systems for businesses, along with consulting systems. For instance, I have worked on projects in Big Data, leveraging Google Cloud Platform to implement Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions for investment consulting, including the deployment of APIs. 

These experiences have equipped me to analyse massive datasets, devise, design, assemble, and resolve various complex analyses, fostering an integrated view of IT business needs. As a comfortable leader, I excel in coordinating teams and achieving goals through the use of Agile methodologies, ensuring alignment with pre-designed planning objectives and KPIs.Specialising in team leadership, I possess skills in managing, consolidating, and directing teams toward set goals. I am very good at conflict resolution in both technical and human challenges.

With a background in management, administration, accounting, economics, costs, budgets, and completion of a Data Science bootcamp with Agile methodologies, I bring a comprehensive skill set to the table.During my tenure as CEO of Beex Logistics, I led IT teams in developing business ideas and building end-to-end web solutions like beex.ar, integrated with Google Analytics. Additionally, as a Functional Analyst in the management control department at O.A.R. S.R.L., I overcame real challenges in management, accounting, administration, human resource performance, fixed assets, and finance. I generated reports to assist my executive team in decision-making.These experiences have honed my leadership, coordination, and communication skills, enabling collaborative efforts to achieve planned objectives.
